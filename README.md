# ChatApp Project
## Application Notes:
Enter a username and server name and then click start. Then in the discovery panel enter a category and click connect. You should see someone else's chatapp instance. You click on them and get their endpoint. Now their room should pop up in the drop down to create a room. You must first create a room and then you can select that room and invite the chatapp instance from the drop down to the room. They should appear in the roster window to the left. Now you can chat with the other person by sending messages or a ying yang message (unkown data type).
